# University-Market
Project for Objest Oriented Software Engineering at UTA
1.	We needed a place to create our software design, and we chose Android Studio. 
a.	Three out of our four of our group members had experience using Android Studio.
2.	Alternatives Considered
a.	Wanting program to be a mobile app instead of website
b.	None of us had developed Apple apps before
3.	Unresolved Issues
a.	We have not considered how we would expand to other forms like Apple Apps or a Website.
b.	There are features to the app that we wanted to include that we will not have time to develop.
